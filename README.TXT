SEHH2242 Object Oriented Programming Group Project - OOP Project

You are working as a maintenance team for a bank to maintain a prototype 
of an ATM system. As a maintenance team, you are required to perform the 
following tasks, Reverse engineering and Reverse engineering.

Part I (Reverse engineering)

Based on the original source codes, construct a Class Diagram to model the
classes and their relationships for the initial prototype of the ATM system.

Part II (Re-engineering)

Suppose that the bank would like to enhance the prototype with the following
new features:

(A) The prototype was originally designed for the use in USA. Adjust the 
selection of options for cash withdrawal to fit in the situation in HK 
(only the multiples of HKD100, HKD500, or HKD1000 are allowed).

(B) Introduce two specific types of bank accounts as subclasses – saving 
account and cheque account: Saving Account has a specific attribute – 
interest rate (with default value of 0.25% per annum); Cheque Account has 
a specific attribute – limit per cheque (with default value HK$50,000).

(C) Remove the deposit function from the existing system

(D) Add a new function – transfer (for transferring fund from one bank 
account to another bank account)

With reference to the above proposed enhancements, your team is responsible 
to reconstruct the Class Diagram that models the modified version of the 
prototype and then implement it in Java.
